Headless HTTP X Remote Controller


Compile and run main.go.

Set the DISPLAY environment variable to ":2056" (can be changed by modifying the display constant)

Run the graphical applications you want

Head over to http://localhost:8080 (can be changed by modifying the httpPort constant) and have a play :)


Designed to be run through a HTTP proxy that only let's HTTP requests through when they are complete and vice versa (the one at my school :( )... Meaning it is REALLY SLOW!!! But it works and can be easily modified to work as a video steam (I will probably add that when I've got the rest of it up to scratch :) )
